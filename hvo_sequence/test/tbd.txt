High Priority Tasks to be done:

    1. [DONE] Add mixed beat_division_factors -->   Works fine except for when tempo and time signature change don't
                                                        overlap
                                                    Also, doesn't work if tempo change in the middle of beat
    2. import directly from midi
    5. [ALMOST DONE] Create a notebook TUTORIAL!!!

Lower Priority Tasks to be done

    # @Marina
        1. implement a hit, velocity property setter

        1. does have velocity variations?
            check per voice:
                get non-zero velocities
                np.var to get variance

            return true if for majority of voices we get variations

        2. does have utiming variations?
        3. is performance?
        4. Flatten a number of voices to a single pitch
                Note: If multiple voices at each time step, grab the loudest (Check with GrooVAE paper)

    # @Teresa
        1. internal method to create spectrogram
                input params: fft_size, hop_size, sr, window, soundfont

        2. Mel Spectrograms
        3. RESET a Voice --> sets a voice to zero (in h, v, and o)
                             based on a list of indices for drum groups
                             exp. [0,1] --> removes kick and snare (if Roland_REDUCED_MAPPING)
                             Note --> remove



    # @ Behzad

    4. Split using given time indices or time in seconds or n_bars
    5. split large using smaller windows and overlap --> maybe better to use an external class
    6. Split at tempo change, split and time_sig change, split at meta change
    4. Implement Appending sequences
    7. save score as png
